### What is NHL Score Tracker?

NHL Score Tracker is a lightweight application that keeps you up to date with the latest hockey scores from around the league. It fetches the latest scores from [Sportsnet](http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/scores/), and displays them in a small, sleek borderless window at the top right corner of your screen.

The interface is split into 'cards' for each game, which contain both team's logos, names, goals scored, and the status of the game (e.g. "12:59 1st", or "FINAL"). You can choose how many games you want to see at a glance, and if there are more games than your preferred number to report, a simple scroll bar appears to easily check all game scores. The refresh interval can be adjusted from 5 seconds to 1 hour, and if you never want to miss an update the tracker can be set to stay on top of all windows, no matter what program you're using! In addition, the tracker will automatically check for updates, so you'll always have the latest features and improvements.

Projects like NHL Score Tracker take lots of effort and dedication to produce and continually improve. Donations are always appreciated, no matter the size!
