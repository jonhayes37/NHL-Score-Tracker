# NHL Scraper v1.0.1

#### What's new in v1.0.1:
- Added automatic score refreshing every 60 seconds, in addition to the manual refresh button.

NHL Scraper is a lightweight application that keeps you up to date with the latest hockey scores from around the league.  
It fetches the latest scores from [Sportsnet](http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/scores/), and displays them in a small, borderless
window at the bottom right corner of your screen.

The interface is split into 'cards' for each game, which contain both team's logos, names, goals scored, and the status of the
game (e.g. 12:59 1st, or FINAL). If there are more than 3 games to report, a simple scroll bar appears to easily check all game
scores.
